        <p>Mohammed Shami Ahmed[b] (born 3 September 1990) is an Indian international cricketer, who plays for the Indian national cricket team in all formats of the game as a bowler. He plays domestically for Bengal and in the Indian Premier League for Gujarat Titans.

            He is a right-arm fast bowler, who has bowled consistently at around 140 km/h (87 mph), moving the ball off the seam and using swing, including reverse swing, to move the ball both ways. He has been described as a fine bowler at the end of a limited-overs innings and as "unplayable" at times in all formats.
            
            Shami made his international debut in a One Day International (ODI) against Pakistan in January 2013, bowling four maiden overs. His Test debut in November 2013 saw him take a five-wicket haul against the West Indies. He is the fastest Indian bowler to take 100 ODI wickets. During the 2019 Cricket World Cup, he became the second Indian bowler to claim a hat-trick in a World Cup match. As of 2022 Shami has an A grade central contract from the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), the second highest grade of contract.
