        <p>Shikhar Dhawan (born 5 December 1985) is an Indian international cricketer. Being a left-handed opening batsman and an occasional right-arm off break bowler, he plays for Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League and Delhi in first-class cricket. At the 2013 Champions Trophy, 2015 World Cup, and 2017 Champions Trophy, Dhawan was the leading run-scorer for India.[4] He also became the first player in the history of IPL to score two back-to-back centuries.[5] He was awarded the 'Player of the Tournament' for his exploits in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and became the third Indian after Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh to win this award in ICC tournaments.

            Dhawan made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Australia in October 2010 at Visakhapatnam. His Test debut came against the same opposition in March 2013 at Mohali, where he scored the fastest century by any batsman on Test debut and ended his innings with 187 runs from 174 balls.
